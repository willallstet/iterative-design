    <div class="main-title">Andi Redesign</div>
    <p>For this project, our group chose Andi, a startup revitalizing search using generative AI & language models. 
      Like talking with a smart friend, Andi generates simple answers to questions, explaining and summarizing information combined from the best sources. 
      While Andi operates across interfaces, we are designed specifically for their mobile application. Andi is specifically for users who are no longer interested in being the product - 
      specifically people frustrated by endless ads, data tracking, and convoluted search results. This encapsulates a large segment of 
      potential customers, but Andi is likely most relevant to users who are digitally native, frequently use search engines like Google or 
      Yahoo (and are familiar with their layout), and are interested in keeping their online usage private. Andi would change the game - 
      no longer needing to deal with endless adverts polluting a user's digital experience, more direct & accurate answers based on 
      searches (helpful for researchers/frequent searchers), and also a friendlier UI that encourages exploration.</p>
    <div class="header">Part 1a: Sketching</div>
    <p>We brainstormed what Andi could look like in the following sketches, ranging from a persona that engages with the
      user to a traditional search engine interface. We also played with the way resluts are shared and organized.

    </div>
    <div class="header">Part 3: User Testing</div>
    <p>After implementing our changes from the critique, we tested our prototype with real users, giving them the following prompt:</p>
    <div class = "block-quote">"Andi is a search engine that uses generative AI models to generate simple answers to your questions. Presented here is a prototype 
    of Andi's user interface designed specifically for mobile users. Suppose you want to visit the Brown Computer Science Department 
    offices. Using Andi, find the location of the Brown CS department and open the location in Apple Maps. As you complete the task, 
    please think aloud so that our designers can better understand your train of thought while using the interface. Thank you!"</div>
    <p>And these subtasks: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using Andi, search for "Brown CS"</li>
      <li>Navigate to the result containing the department's location</li>
      <li>Open the building's location in "Maps"</li>
    </ul>
  <p>From our first respondent, we noticed that he struggled with the second subtask, when attempting our given task, to find the address of 
  the Brown CS Building. He found the search bar easily and was able to determine what each component on the page was. However, 
  he expressed trouble figuring out whether he was supposed to select from the field of search queries automatically populated in 
  the search bar or to click the search button call-to-action (CTA). This struggle is something that we anticipated, as our prototype 
  only used a mock version of type-to-search functionality, so the search queries populating the dropdown menu were not based on anything 
  the user typed in. This initial confusion was likely due to the user&apos;s mental model of type-to-search dropdowns in other interfaces, where, 
  as you type, results are listed. However, our given dropdown menu only displayed content that we manually added to display on the screen. The user did, however, 
  successfully search for Brown CS (one of our subtasks).
  <br><br>
  Once the users completed this task, they were able to successfully search on our interface and complete the remaining subtasks, 
  accomplishing our main task of finding the address for Brown CS. A piece of feedback we got from this user was to make the interface 
  more indicative of the tasks the user needs to take on that given page. The second respondent was able to complete the task quickly and 
  validated our expectation that the interface would be intuitive for a user unfamiliar with Andi, stating that the app was “simple and 
  easy to use” (1:32 in video 4342277B). We found that the third user had an easy time navigating through the app and completing the 
  task as well. She did struggle with the final sub-task of navigating from the individual search result page to the “open in maps” button. 
  Both the third and first users expressed difficulty with noticing the maps icon when on the search results page. Since this was a 
  bottleneck for completing the final sub-task of getting to the map view for two of the three users, we think that an area for improvement 
  on our interface would be <br>1) making the map icon more prominent to the user and <br>2) making the task more clear on the screen overall. </p>
