      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <div class="main-title">Andi Redesign</div>
    <p>For this project, our group chose Andi, a startup revitalizing search using generative AI & language models. 
      Like talking with a smart friend, Andi generates simple answers to questions, explaining and summarizing information combined from the best sources. 
      While Andi operates across interfaces, we are designed specifically for their mobile application. Andi is specifically for users who are no longer interested in being the product - 
      specifically people frustrated by endless ads, data tracking, and convoluted search results. This encapsulates a large segment of 
      potential customers, but Andi is likely most relevant to users who are digitally native, frequently use search engines like Google or 
      Yahoo (and are familiar with their layout), and are interested in keeping their online usage private. Andi would change the game - 
      no longer needing to deal with endless adverts polluting a user's digital experience, more direct & accurate answers based on 
      searches (helpful for researchers/frequent searchers), and also a friendlier UI that encourages exploration.</p>
    <div class="header">Part 1a: Sketching</div>
    <p>We brainstormed what Andi could look like in the following sketches, ranging from a persona that engages with the
      user to a traditional search engine interface. We also played with the way resluts are shared and organized.

    <div class="header">Part 3: User Testing</div>
    <p>After implementing our changes from the critique, we tested our prototype with real users, giving them the following prompt: <br><br>
    "Andi is a search engine that uses generative AI models to generate simple answers to your questions. Presented here is a prototype 
    of Andi's user interface designed specifically for mobile users. Suppose you want to visit the Brown Computer Science Department 
    offices. Using Andi, find the location of the Brown CS department and open the location in Apple Maps. As you complete the task, 
    please think aloud so that our designers can better understand your train of thought while using the interface. Thank you!"</p>
