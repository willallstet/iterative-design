      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <div class="main-title">Andi Redesign</div>
    For this project, our group chose Andi, a startup revitalizing search using generative AI & language models. Like talking with a smart friend, Andi generates simple answers to questions, explaining and summarizing information combined from the best sources. While Andi is applicable across interfaces, we are designing specifically for a mobile application. Andi is specifically for users who are no longer interested in being the product - specifically people frustrated by endless ads, data tracking, and convoluted search results. This encapsulates a large segment of potential customers, but Andi is likely most relevant to users who are digitally native, frequently use search engines like Google or Yahoo (and are familiar with their layout), and are interested in keeping their online usage private. Andi would change the game - no longer needing to deal with endless adverts polluting a user's digital experience, more direct & accurate answers based on searches (helpful for researchers/frequent searchers), and also a friendlier UI that encourages exploration.
